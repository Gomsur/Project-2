# **Row of 3**
## **Site Overview**
I decided to make a game called three in a row or row of three, a classic board game where two players challenge eachother in a game of whoever gets three of their markers in a row first.
However it can also end up being a draw game, where both players cant put more of their markers on the game board and would have to challenge eachother in another game.

## **Planning stage**

### **Target Audiences:**
* Users interested in retro gaming 
* Users interested in a challenging one versus one game
* Users who wants a simple quick game

​
### **User Stories:**
* As a user, I want the game to be quick and easy to navigate
* As a user, I want the game to be repeatable (play again option)
* As a user, I want the retro feeling of a game

​
### **Site Aims:**
* Give the user a retro playable game
* 1 versus 1 game type
* Repeatable game type

​
### **Color Scheme:**
​
When hovering your marker, both on 'X' and 'O' I made the hovering indication green (rgb(1, 121, 67)
When you set your marker, both with 'X' and 'O' I decided to go with a classic (black, #030100;) indication to get an easy classic touch.
The winning message button I wanted to have a solid white (white) background, to make it easy for the end user to navigate.
The text of the winning player I wanted to be the same color as the game itself, so here I chose (rgb(1, 121, 67);) aswell.
For hovering I went with the same as mentioned above, to get the same red thread throught he project (rgb(1, 121, 67);)

* rgb(1, 121, 67);
* (black, #030100;)
* (white)
​

## **Typography**
* Throughout the page, these fonts were used:
  * 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; - for the winning message
  * Times new roman - For instructions

​
## **Current Features Common to all pages**
​
#### **features**
​
## **Future-Enhancements**
* A scoreboard would be possible to make, keeping track of both 'X' and 'O's scores, for users who wants to play three games for example.
​
* It would be possible to make the board even bigger, for the game to be playable even harder or just make the game play last longer.
​

## **Testing Phase**
* Responsiveness -  I checked the responsiveness with the inspect tool, seeing that it is responsive on all different phones, tablets and computers.
​
* Functionality - Everything regarding functionality works, i pressed everything and it works, the only thing not being as i expected it to be, is the hovering and color scheme on the tablet.
​
* Validators - I used jshint for java, jigsaw for css & for HTML I used validator.w3

## **Bugs**
* Issue - I was not able to place the different markers, making them stick to the board game.
* Cause - I placed my java files to overrun
* Resolution - Swapped lines on the java files so that the other one did not overrun the first one.

* Issue - When 'X' for example won, you could still place more markers on the board, not ending the game
* Cause - The game ended but I needed something to make the player aware of it
* Resolution - Added a winning message that caught the players attention.

​
1. From the project's [repository](https://github.com/Gomsur/Project-2), go to the **Settings** tab.
2. From the left-hand menu, select the **Pages** tab.
3. Under the **Source** section, select the **Main** branch from the drop-down menu and click **Save**.
4. A message will be displayed to indicate a successful deployment to GitHub pages and provide the live link.
